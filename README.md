## Vicente Reig Rincón de Arellano

Fractional product engineer, mostly working with startups from bootstrap through Series B. I build products—and sometimes the teams who build them.

I like the cathedral-builder's view: zoom out, watch where the pilgrims go, decide where the next window belongs. I don't need to source the glass myself.

Previously at **Apple**, **Atlassian**, and **New Relic**.

## Current interests

I maintain [DSPy.rb](https://github.com/vicentereig/dspy.rb)—I got tired of prompting LLMs and wanted to program them instead. Turns out other people felt the same way.

I'm also working on [A2UI Rails](https://github.com/vicentereig/a2ui-rails)—a port of Google's A2UI for Rails using DSPy.rb and Turbo Streams. LLMs generate typed UI descriptions, not code; the client renders trusted ViewComponents.

I keep building CLIs. Can't seem to stop. There's something satisfying about giving people direct access to their own data—no dashboards, no waiting, just a terminal and a question. Most of these started as tools I needed myself.
